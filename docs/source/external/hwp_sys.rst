HWP_sys
=======


This module implements HWP non-idealities both using Jones formalism (as 
described in `Giardiello et al. 2021 <https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.08031>`_) and the Mueller one. In
the Jones formalism, a non-ideal HWP is described by

.. math::
   :label: non_ideal_hwp_jones

   J_{HWP} = \begin{pmatrix} 1+h_{1} & \zeta_{1} e^{i \chi_1}\\ \zeta_{2} e^{i \chi_2}& -(1+h_{2}) e^{i \beta} \\ \end{pmatrix}

where:

*  :math:`h_1` and :math:`h_2` are the efficiencies, describing the deviation from the unitary
   transmission of light components :math:`E_x`, :math:`E_y`. In the ideal case, 
   :math:`h_1 = h_2 = 0`;
*  :math:`\beta=\phi-\pi`, where :math:`\phi` is the phase shift between the two 
   directions. It accounts for variations of the phase difference between :math:`E_x`
   and :math:`E_y` with respect to the nominal value of :math:`\pi` for an ideal HWP.
   In the ideal case, :math:`\beta=0`;
*  :math:`\zeta_{1,2}` and :math:`\chi_{1,2}` are amplitudes and phases of the 
   off-diagonal terms, coupling :math:`E_x` and :math:`E_y`. In practice, if the
   incoming wave is fully polarized along x(y), a spurious y(x) component would 
   show up in the outgoing wave. In the ideal case, :math:`\zeta_{1,2}=\chi_{1,2}=0`.

In the Mueller formalism, we have a general matrix

.. math::
   :label: non_ideal_hwp_mueller

   J_{HWP} = \begin{pmatrix} M^{TT} & M^{TQ} & M^{TU} \\ M^{QT} & M^{QQ} & M^{QU} \\ M^{UT} & M^{UQ} & M^{UU} \\ \end{pmatrix}

which, in the ideal case, would be

.. math::
   :label: ideal_hwp_mueller

   J_{HWP} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 & 0 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 & 0 \\ 0 & 0 & -1 \\ \end{pmatrix}

In the most general case, the Jones non-ideal parameters and the Mueller matrix elements can vary inside a bandpass.

The class :class:`.hwp_sys.HwpSys` is a contanier for the parameters of the HWP systematics.
It defines three methods:

*  :meth:`.hwp_sys.HwpSys.set_parameters` which sets the defaults and handles the interface with 
   the parameter file of the simulation. The relevant section is tagged by ``[hwp_sys]``. The HWP 
   parameters can be passed both in the Jones and Mueller formalism. This choice is regulated by 
   the flag ``mueller_or_jones``, which has to be set to either ``"mueller"`` or ``"jones"``. In
   case the Jones formalism is chosen, it is converted automatically into the Mueller one through
   the function ``.hwp_sys.JonesToMueller``. There is also the possibility to pass precomputed input 
   maps (as a numpy array) through the ``maps`` argument. Otherwise, input maps are internally 
   computed through the litebird_sim map based simulator (mbs).
   The argument ``integrate_in_band`` sets whether band integration is performed in the TOD 
   computation; if ``built_map_on_the_fly = True``, the map-making can be performed internally
   (instead of using the litebird_sim binner); ``correct_in_solver`` sets whether non-ideal 
   parameters can be used in the map-making (map-making assuming a non-ideal HWP, generally using 
   different HWP non-ideal parameters than the one used in the TOD, representing our estimate of
   their true value); ``integrate_in_band_solver`` regulates whether band integration is performed
   in the map-making (to compute the :math:`B^T B` and :math:`B^T d` terms, see below).  


*  :meth:`.hwp_sys.HwpSys.fill_tod` which fills the tod in a given Observation. The ``pointings`` 
   angles passed have to include no rotating HWP, since the effect of the rotating HWP to the 
   polarization angle is included in the TOD computation.
   The TOD is computed performing this operation:

   :math:`d_{obs}\left(t_{i}\right)\,=\,\frac{\int d\nu\,\frac{\partial BB(\nu,T)}{\partial T_{CMB}}\,\tau\left(\nu\right)\,M_{i}^{TX}(\nu)\left(m_{CMB}+m_{FG}\left(\nu\right)\right)}{\int d\nu \frac{\partial BB(\nu,T)}{\partial T_{CMB}}\,\tau \left(\nu\right)}`, 
   
   where :math:`\tau(\nu)` is the bandpass, 
   :math:`\frac{\partial BB(\nu,T)}{\partial T_{CMB}}` converts from CMB thermodynamic temperature 
   to differential source intensity (see eq.8 of https://arxiv.org/abs/1303.5070) and 
   :math:`M_{i}^{TX}(\nu)` is the Mueller matrix element including the non-ideal HWP.

   If ``built_map_on_the_fly = True``, the code computes also 
   
   :math:`m_{out} = {\,\left(\sum_{i} B_{i}^{T} B_{i} \right)^{-1} \left( \sum_{i} B_{i}^{T} d_{obs}(t_{i}) \right)}`, 
   
   where the map-making matrix :math:`B^X = \left(\frac{\int d\nu \,\frac{\partial BB(\nu,T)}{\partial T_{CMB}}\,\tau_{s}\left(\nu\right)\,M_{i,s}^{TX}(\nu)}{\int d\nu \frac{\partial BB(\nu,T)}{\partial T_{CMB}}\,\tau_{s}\left(\nu\right)}\,\right)`. 
   
   :math:`\tau_s(\nu)` and :math:`M_{i,s}^{TX}(\nu)` are the estimate of
   the bandpass and Mueller matrix elements used in the map-making.

*  :meth:`.hwp_sys.HwpSys.make_map` which can bin the observations in a map. This is available only
   if ``built_map_on_the_fly`` variable is set to ``True``. With this method, it is possible to 
   include non-ideal HWP knowledge in the map-making procedure, so use that instead of the general
   ``litebird_sim`` binner if you want to do so.

Defining a bandpass profile in ``hwp_sys``
------------------------------------------

It is possible to define more complex bandpass profiles than a top-hat when using ``hwp_sys``.
This can be done both for the TOD computation (:math:`\tau`) and the map-making procedure
(:math:`\tau_s`). All you have to do is create a dictionary with key "hwp_sys" in the parameter
file (a toml file) assigned to the simulation:

.. code-block:: python

  sim = lbs.Simulation(
      parameter_file=toml_filename,
      random_seed=0,
   ) 
 
The dictionary under the key "hwp_sys" will also contain the paths to the files from which the HWP 
parameters are read in the multifrequency case (under the keys "band_filename/band_filename_solver"), or their values in the single frequency one. See the notebook ``hwp_sys/examples/simple_scan`` 
for more details.
To define the bandpasses to use, you need to have a dictionary with key "bandpass" 
(for :math:`\tau`) or "bandpass_solver" (for :math:`\tau_s`) under "hwp_sys":

.. code-block:: python

  paramdict = {...
                "hwp_sys": {...
                   "band_filename": path_to_HWP_param_file,
                   "band_filename_solver": path_to_HWP_solver_param_file,
                   "bandpass": {"band_type": "cheby",
                                "band_low_edge": band_low_edge,
                                "band_high_edge": band_high_edge,
                                "bandcenter_ghz": bandcenter_ghz,
                                "band_ripple_dB": ripple_dB_tod,
                                "band_order": args.order_tod},
                   "bandpass_solver": {...},
                 ...}}

The above example is for a bandpass with Chebyshev filter, but there are other parameters to define
different bandpass profile. It is important to define the "band_type", which can be "top-hat", 
"top-hat-exp", "top-hat-cosine" and "cheby" (see the ``bandpass`` module for more details) 
and the band edges, which define the frequency range over which the bandpass transmission 
is close or equal to 1. If not assigned, the "band_type" is automatically set to "top-hat" 
and the band edges will correspond to the limits of the frequency array used (which, in the
``hwp_sys`` module, is read from the HWP parameter files). There are default values also for 
the parameters defining the specific bandpass profiles (see the 
``hwp_sys/hwp_sys/bandpass_template_module`` code).

There is also the possibility to read the bandpass profile from an external file, which has to be
a .txt file with two columns, the frequency and the bandpass transmission. It is important that the
frequency array used for "bandpass/bandpass_solver" coincides with the ones passed in the 
"band_filename/band_filename_solver" file. Here is how to pass the bandpass file:

.. code-block:: python

  paramdict = {...
                "hwp_sys": {...
                   "band_filename": path_to_HWP_param_file,
                   "band_filename_solver": path_to_HWP_solver_param_file,
                   "bandpass": {"bandpass_file": path_to_bandpass_file },
                   "bandpass_solver": {"bandpass_file": path_to_bandpass_solver_file},
                 ...}}

You can find more examples for the bandpass construction in the ``hwp_sys/examples/simple_scan`` notebook.
