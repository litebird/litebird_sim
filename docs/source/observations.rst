Observations
============

The :class:`.Observation` class, is the container for the data acquired by the
telescope during a scaning period (and the relevant information about it).

Serial applications 
-------------------

In a serial code :class:`.Observation` is equivalent to an empty class in which you
can put anything::

  import litebird_sim as lbs
  import numpy as np

  obs = lbs.Observation(
      detectors=2,
      start_time_global=0.0,
      sampling_rate_hz=5.0,
      n_samples_global=5,
  )

  obs.my_new_attr = 'value'
  setattr(obs, 'another_new_attr', 'another value')

Across the framework, the coherence in the names and content of the attributes
is guaranteed **by convention** (no check is done by the :class:`.Observation`
class).

There are two more conventions. First, ``obs.tod`` is a 2-D array.
``obs.tod[0]`` is the time stream of the first detector.
``obs.tod[:, 0]`` are the first time sample of all the detectors.
Second, detector-specific attributes are collected in arrays:
``obs.calibration_factors`` is a 1-D array with one entry per
detector.

Thus, typical operations look like this::

  # Collect detector properties in arrays
  obs.calibration_factors = np.array([1.1, 1.2])
  obs.wn_levels = np.array([2.1, 2.2])

  # Apply to each detector its own calibration factor
  obs.tod *=  obs.calibration_factors[:, None]

  # Add white noise at a different level for each detector
  obs.tod += (np.random.normal(size=obs.tod.shape)
              * obs.wn_levels[:, None])

Parallel applications
---------------------

The only work that the :class:`.Observation` class actually does is handling
parallelism. ``obs.tod`` can be distributed over a 
``n_blocks_det`` by ``n_blocks_time`` grid of MPI ranks. The blocks can be
changed at run-time.

The coherence between the serial and parallel operations is achieved by
distributing also the arrays of detector properties:
each rank keeps in memory only an interval of ``calibration_factors`` or
``wn_levels``, the same detector interval of ``tod``.

The main advantage is that the example operations in the Serial section are
achieved with the same lines of code.
The price to pay is that you have to set detector properties with special methods.

::

  import litebird_sim as lbs
  from mpi4py import MPI

  comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD

  obs = lbs.Observation(
      detectors=2,
      start_time_global=0.0,
      sampling_rate_hz=5.0,
      n_samples_global=5,
      n_blocks_det=2, # Split the detector axis in 2
      comm=comm  # across the processes of this communicator
  )

  # Add detector properties either with a global array that contains 
  # all the detectors (which will be scattered across the processor grid)
  obs.setattr_det_global('calibration_factors', np.array([1.1, 1.2]))
  
  # Or with the local array, if somehow you have it already
  if comm.rank == 0:
      wn_level_local = np.array([2.1])
  elif comm.rank == 1:
      wn_level_local = np.array([2.2])
  else:
      wn_level_local = np.array([])
  obs.setattr_det('wn_levels', wn_level_local)
  
  # Operate on the local portion of the data just like in serial code

  # Apply to each detector its own calibration factor
  obs.tod *=  obs.calibration_factors[:, None]

  # Add white noise at a different level for each detector
  obs.tod += (np.random.normal(size=obs.tod.shape)
              * obs.wn_levels[:, None])

  # Change the data distribution
  obs.set_blocks(n_blocks_det=1, n_blocks_time=1)
  # Now the rank 0 has exactly the data of the serial obs object

For clarity, here is a visualization of how data (a detector attribute and the
TOD) gets distributed.

When ``n_blocks_det != 1``,  keep in mind that ``obs.tod[0]`` or
``obs.wn_levels[0]`` are quantities of the first *local* detector, not global.
This should not be a problem as the only thing that matters is that the two
quantities refer to the same detector. If you need the global detector index,
you can get it with ``obs.det_idx[0]``, which is created
at construction time.

Other notable functionalities
-----------------------------

The starting time can be represented either as floating-point values
(appropriate in 99% of the cases) or MJD; in the latter case, it
is handled through the `AstroPy <https://www.astropy.org/>`_ library.

Instead of adding detector attributes after construction, you can pass a list of
dictionaries (one entry for each detectors). One attribute is created for every
key.

::

  import litebird_sim as lbs
  from astropy.time import Time
  
  # Second case: use MJD to track the time
  obs_mjd = lbs.Observation(
      detectors=[{"name": "A"}, {"name": "B"}]
      start_time_global=Time("2020-02-20", format="iso"),
      sampling_rate_hz=5.0,
      nsamples_global=5,
  )

  obs.name == np.array(["A", "B"])  # True
