Scanning strategy
=================

The LiteBIRD Simulation Framework provides a set of tools to simulate
the orbit of the spacecraft and to compute the directions where each
detector is looking at the sky, as a function of time. The time stream
of directions and orientations of each detector is usually called
*pointing information*, and we'll consistently use this jargon in the
documentation.

This chapter provides an in-depth explanation about how to use the
facilities provided by the framework to compute the pointing
information for any detector in one of the focal planes.

The spacecraft's motion
-----------------------

In the case of a space mission like LiteBIRD, the motion of the
spacecraft and its structure decide where each detector is looking at
each time. The following video shows qualitatively which kind of
motion is simulated by our framework:

(The animation was created using `POV-Ray <http://povray.org/>`_, and
the files used to create it are available on `GitHub
<https://github.com/ziotom78/povray_scanning_strategy>`_ .)

You can see that there are *two* rotations in the animation: the
spacecraft spins quickly around its spin axis (grey axis), but this
axis does not stand still: it performs a precession around the blue
axis, which represents the Sun-Earth direction. (You should imagine
the Earth on the left, and the Sun on the very far left.)

Note that the detectors are not necessarily aligned with the spin
axis; in fact, the animation shows the actual direction of observation
for two different detectors as two red and green lines: you can see
that they are looking quite at two opposite sides of the spin axis.
Every detector looks along its own direction, but detectors belonging
to the same instrument (e.g., LFT) look not far away from each other;
it is customary to express their pointing directions relative to an
«average» direction, called the *boresight direction*, which is the
main optical axis of the instrument. Since in LiteBIRD there are
*three* instruments (LFT, MFT, HFT), there should be boresight
directions; however, MFT and HFT share the same telescope, and thus
it's customary to show only one boresight. This is the true meaning of
the red and green axes in the video above: the red axis represents the
«average» direction where LFT detectors are looking at, and the green
axis is the same for MFT/HFT.

The animation does not show a *third* rotation happening, which is the
revolution of the spacecraft around the Sun, taking one year to
complete. (Including it in the video would have been useless, as it is
*really* slow when compared with the spin and precession!). This means
that the motion of the spacecraft is the composition of *three*
rotations:

1. Rotation of the spacecraft around the spin axis (grey line);

2. Rotation (precession) of the spin axis around the Sun-Earth axis
   (blue line);

3. Yearly rotation of the Sun-Earth axis around the Sun.

If you think about it, you will realize that the kinematics of this
motion can be fully described by the following quantities:

- The angle between the spin axis and the boresight direction(s),
  usually called β;

- The angle between the spin axis and the Sun-Earth axis, usually
  called α.

- The speed of the rotation of the boresight direction around the spin
  axis;

- The speed of the precession around the Sun-Earth axis, which is
  usually slower than the rotation speed;


They are sketched in the following diagram:

.. image:: images/litebird-scanning-strategy.svg


These parameters define the so-called *scanning strategy*, i.e., the
way the instruments observe the sky during the mission's lifetime. The
LiteBIRD Simulation Framework provides all the tools necessary to
simulate the composition of these rotations, and it can produce
pointing information from the synthetic description of the scanning
strategy. Here is a full example, using the scanning strategy proposed
for CORE (:cite:`2018:core:delabrouille`), which is qualitatively
similar to what is going to be used for LiteBIRD:

.. testcode::

  import litebird_sim as lbs
  import astropy.units as u

  sim = lbs.Simulation(
      start_time=0,
      duration_s=60.0,
      description="Sample simulation",
  )

  # We now simulate the motion of the spacecraft over a time span
  # of one minute (specified in the `duration_s` parameter above).
  sim.generate_spin2ecl_quaternions(
      scanning_strategy=lbs.SpinningScanningStrategy(
          spin_sun_angle_deg=30, # CORE-specific parameter
          spin_rate_rpm=0.5,     # Ditto
          # We use astropy to convert the period (4 days) in
          # minutes, the unit expected for the precession period
          precession_period_min=(4 * u.day).to("min").value,
      )
  )
  instr = lbs.Instrument(name="core", spin_boresight_angle_deg=65)

  # The motion of the spacecraft is now encoded in a set of quaternions,
  # in the field `sim.spin2ecliptic_quats`. We use it to produce the
  # pointing information for a fake boresight detector `det`, belonging
  # to the instrument `core` (unlike LiteBIRD, CORE had only one focal
  # plane and one instrument)
  det = lbs.Detector(name="foo", sampling_rate_hz=10)
  obs, = sim.create_observations(detectors=[det])
  pointings = obs.get_pointings(
      sim.spin2ecliptic_quats,
      detector_quats=[det.quat],
      bore2spin_quat=instr.bore2spin_quat,
  )

  print("Shape:", pointings.shape)
  print("Pointings:")
  print(pointings)

.. testoutput::

  Shape: (1, 600, 3)
  Pointings:
  [[[ 2.18166156  0.         -1.57079633]
    [ 2.18164984 -0.00579129 -1.57633021]
    [ 2.18161186 -0.01158231 -1.58186382]
    ...
    [ 0.08854811 -2.96748668 -1.73767999]
    [ 0.08788054 -3.0208052  -1.68678085]
    [ 0.08745441 -3.07477554 -1.63522983]]]

All the details in this code are explained in the next sections, so
for now just keep in mind the overall shape of the code:

1. Once the duration of the simulation (one hour in the example
   above), we call the method
   :meth:`.Simulation.generate_spin2ecl_quaternions`, which forces the
   framework to compute how the orientation of the spacecraft with
   respect to the sky sphere evolves with time. This method produces a
   set of `quaternions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion>`_,
   which encode the result of the composition of all the rotations
   (spin, precession, revolution around the Sun) described above;
   these quaternions are saved in the ``spin2ecliptic_quats`` field of
   the ``sim`` class.

2. When the simulation code needs to determine where a detector is
   pointing to (the detector ``det`` in our example), the quaternions
   are used to retrieve (1) the coordinates on the Sky sphere, and (2)
   the polarization angle. Both quantities are computed in the
   Ecliptic reference frame using the sampling rate of the detector,
   which in our example is 10 Hz (i.e., ten samples per second). In
   the example above, this is done by the method
   :meth:`.Observation.get_pointings`.

3. The method :meth:`.Observation.get_pointings` returns a ``(N, 3)``
   matrix, where the first column contains the colatitude
   :math:`\theta`, the second column the longitude :math:`\phi`, and
   the third column the polarization angle :math:`\psi`, all expressed
   in radians.


Computing the spacecraft's orientation
--------------------------------------

To compute where a detector is looking at the sky sphere, there is a
number of transformation that need to be carried out:

.. image:: images/coordinate-systems.svg

We start from the detector's reference frame, which assumes that the
main beam of the radiation pattern is aligned with the `z` axis, and
that the detector is sensitive to the polarization along the `x` axis.

The next reference frame is the *boresight*, and to convert from the
detector's reference frame to the boresight there is a rotation, which
is encoded in a quaternion that is saved in the IMO.

Next, we move from the reference frame of the boresight to that of the
spacecraft. The information about the placement of the boresight with
respect to the spin axis is encoded in the class :class:`Instrument`.
After this transformation, the spin axis is aligned with the `z` axis.

The next transformation goes from the spacecraft's to the Ecliptic
reference frame; the Ecliptic is on the `xy` plane, and the `z` axis
points towards the Ecliptic North Pole. In this case, the framework
provides two ways to compute the transformation:

1. The revolution of the Earth around the Sun is modelled using a
   plain circular motion, and the starting position is arbitrary; this
   mode is triggered whenever the time is tracked using floating-point
   numbers (i.e., the parameter `start_time` in the constructor of
   :class:`.Simulation` is a ``float``).

2. The proper motion of the Earth around the Sun is computed using
   ephemeridis tables; the calculation is much slower, but the result
   enables to properly simulate the observation of moving objects in
   the Solar System, like planets or asteroids. In this case, the
   parameter `start_time` must be an instance of the class
   ``astropy.time.Time``. In the example above, we would enable the
   computation of proper Earth's motion with the following small
   change::

     import astropy.time

     sim = lbs.Simulation(
         # Turn on full computation of the Earth's orbit around the Sun
         start_time=astropy.time.Time("2020-01-01"),
         duration_s=60.0,
         description="Sample simulation",
     )

You should compute the proper motion of the Earth around the Sun only
if you absolutely need to, as the computation can be 10÷100 times
slower.


From quaternions to detector pointings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To compute the pointing information for a detector, the quaternions
computed through the call to
:meth:`.Simulation.generate_spin2ecl_quaternions` are not enough, as
they only tell how to convert a vector from the *spin axis* reference
frame to the Ecliptic reference frame. We need two more quaternions
that tell how to convert from the reference frame of the detector to
that of the spin axis:

1. The first quaternion describes how the detector reference frame
   (with the `z` axis aligned with the main axis of the radiation
   pattern) can be converted to the reference frame of the focal plane
   (with the `z` axis aligned with the boresight). This information is
   included in the IMO and is properly initialized if you call
   :meth:`.Detector.from_imo`. If you do not specify any quaternion,
   the constructor for :class:`.Detector` will assume that the
   detector is looking at the boresight, and it will thus use the
   quaternion :math:`(0 0 0 1)`; this is the case of the simple
   example we presented above.

2. The second quaternion describes how to convert the reference frame
   of the focal plane (with the `z` axis aligned with the boresight)
   to the reference frame of the spacecraft (where the `z` axis is
   aligned with its spin axis). This quaternion is stored in the field
   ``bore2spin_quat`` of the class :class:`.Instrument`.

The LiteBIRD Simulation Framework recomputes the orientation of the
spacecraft with a regular spacing in time (the default is one minute).
However, pointings need to be known at the same sampling frequency
used by the detector, which is usually much higher than the frequency
used to compute the quaternions (in our example above, the sampling
frequency of detector ``det`` was 10 Hz, but the sampling frequency of
the quaternions was 1/60 Hz). Since the framework uses quaternions to
encode the orientation of the spacecraft, oversampling them to the
sampling frequency of the detector is just a matter of applying a
spherical linear interpolation (abbr. `slerp
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slerp>`_), according to the following
figure:

.. image:: images/quaternion-sampling.svg

To be sure to include an additional quaternion *after* the last
sample, like in the figure above, the framework provides the static
method :meth:`ScanningStrategy.optimal_num_of_quaternions`, which
computes how many quaternions need to be calculated to cover some time
span with a given interval between quaternions. For instance, if our
simulation lasts 100 s and we want one quaternion every minute, then
the expected number of quaternions to be computed is 3: one at
:math:`t = 0`, one at :math:`t = 60\,\mathrm{s}`, and one at :math:`t
= 120\,\mathrm{s}`, so that the latter two can be interpolated for the
samples in the range :math:`60\,\mathrm{s} \leq t \leq
100\,\mathrm{s}`. Here is how the function works:

.. testcode::

   print(lbs.ScanningStrategy.optimal_num_of_quaternions(
       time_span_s=100,
       delta_time_s=60,
   ))

.. testoutput::

   3

When using MPI, the relatively small size in memory of the quaternions
(the thick black lines in the figure) enables the framework to keep
the a duplicate of the list in all the MPI processes. This is unlike
what happens with the data in TODs (the thin gray lines), which are
split in several instances of the :class:`.Observation` class.

.. note::

   Slerp assumes a rotation with constant angular speed between
   consecutive quaternions, and thus it only approximates the true
   composition of all the rotations (spin, precession, revolution
   around the Sun) that we have discussed above. However, don't forget
   that the *real* spacecraft will follow a scanning strategy that
   will be more complex than the one described by our geometrical
   model, because of many non-idealities that are unavoidable in a
   spacecraft. The approximation of the «slerp» operation is thus
   unlikely to be relevant.

Once all the quaternions have been computed at the proper sampling
rate, the direction of the detector on the sky and its polarization
angle are computed as follows:

- The direction is simply the vector :math:`\vec d = R \hat e_z`,
  where :math:`R` is the overall rotation from the detector's
  reference frame to the Ecliptic reference frame, and :math:`\hat e_z
  = (0, 0, 1)` is the one-length vector aligned with the `z` axis.

- The polarization angle is given by the angle between the North
  direction passing through the vector :math:`\vec d` (i.e., along the
  parallel of :math:`\vec d`) and the vector :math:`\vec p = R \hat
  e_x`, where :math:`R` is the same as above and :math:`\hat e_x = (1,
  0, 0)`, as shown in the following figure:

.. image:: images/polarization-direction.svg

The purpose of the method :meth:`.Observation.get_pointings`, used in
the example at the beginning of this chapter, is to call
:meth:`.Observation.get_det2ecl_quaternions` to compute the
quaternions at the same sampling frequency as the scientific
datastream, and then to apply the two definitions above to compute the
direction and the polarization angle.


How the boresight is specified
------------------------------

As LiteBIRD includes three focal planes and two telescopes, the
specification of the boresight requires some care. In
:cite:`2018:core:delabrouille` and :cite:`2019:pico:hanany`, the
boresight direction is encoded using just one number, the angle
between the boresight and the spin axis. However, both papers deal
with spacecrafts hosting only *one* focal plane.

The full orientation of the boresight direction is specified using
three angles:

1. The ψ angle encodes the rotation of the focal plane with respect to
   the boresight direction itself, and it is ideally 0°;

2. The angle between the boresight direction and the spin axis is
   usually notated with the symbol β (among the three, this is the
   most important number: it's 65° for CORE, 69° for PICO);

3. Finally, the boresight can be rotated by an angle φ around the spin
   axis: this is important only when you have more than one focal
   plane. For LiteBIRD, :math:`\phi_\text{LFT} - \phi_\text{MHFT}
   \approx 180^\circ`.

Interpretation of pointings
---------------------------

We saw in the example above that the pointings for detector ``det``
were saved in a matrix of shape ``N × 3``, but the meaning of those
numbers are probably unclear. With «pointing», we refer to two
different concept:

1. The direction where the detector is looking at;

2. The orientation of the detector while it's looking at the sky.

The direction can be encoded either as a one-length vector ``(x, y,
z)`` or as a couple of angles; the LiteBIRD simulation framework
adopts the second option to save memory, and it encodes directions
using the colatitude (i.e., 90° minus the latitude) and the longitude,
commonly indicated with the letters θ (colatitude) and φ (longitude).

The orientation of the detector (second point above) can be expressed
either as a vector that is tangent to the sky sphere, or as an angle
calculated with respect to the meridian/parallel going through the
point the detector is looking at. Again, to reduce memory usage, our
framework only encodes the angle.

Thus, the method :meth:`.Observation.get_pointings` returns a N×3
matrix whose columns contain the colatitude (in radians), longitude
(ditto), and polarization angle with respect to the North and South
poles of the sky. Let's visualize the position of these pointings on a
Healpix map::

   import healpy, numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pylab as plt

   nside = 64
   pixidx = healpy.ang2pix(nside, pointings[:, 0], pointings[:, 1])
   m = np.zeros(healpy.nside2npix(nside))
   m[pixidx] = 1
   healpy.mollview(m)

Custom scanning strategies
--------------------------

In this section we explain how scanning strategies different from the
nominal, «spinning» strategy can be modelled. You will need to
understand the functions provided by the framework to deal with
quaternions.

The framework uses a right-handed coordinate system, like the one
shown in figure:

.. image:: images/right-handed-coordinates.svg

where the grey arrows indicate the verse of *positive* rotations (they
follow the usual right-hand rule: point your thumb along the axis, and
the other fingers will point towards the positive direction of the
rotation).


A few words about quaternions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To describe a rotation in 3D space, there are several choices: `Euler
angles <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_angles>`_, `rotation
matrices <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix>`_,
`quaternions <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quaternion>`_, etc. Each
of these systems has its own share of advantages and disadvantages:
for instance, rotation matrices are handy when you have a vector and
want to rotate it, as it's just a matter of doing a matrix-vector
multiplication. Quaternions are more complicated on this regard, but
they offer a mathematical operation called *slerp* (shorthand for
*spherical linear interpolation*), which is incredibly useful and not
available with other representations, like rotation matrices. We
assume that the reader knows what quaternion are and their
mathematical properties; if you are not, be sure to read the book
*Visualizing quaternions*, by Andrew J. Hanson (Elsevier, 2006,
ISBN-0080474772) and the provocative essay by Marc ten Bosch, `Let's
remove Quaternions from every 3D engine
<https://marctenbosch.com/quaternions/>`_.

The LiteBIRD simulation framework models quaternions using the
convention :math:`(v_x, v_y, v_z, w)`; be aware that some textbooks
use the order :math:`(w, v_x, v_y, v_z)`. As the framework uses
quaternions only to model rotations, they all must obey the relation
:math:`v_x^2 + v_y^2 + v_z^2 + w^2 = 1` (*normalized* quaternions),
which is a property satisfied by rotation quaternions.


Python functions for quaternions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The LiteBIRD Simulation Framework provides three functions,
:func:`quat_rotation_x`, :func:`quat_rotation_y`, :func:`quat_rotation_z` to
compute simple rotation quaternions; they return the normalized
quaternion representing a rotation by an angle :math:`\theta` around
one of the three axis `x`, `y`, and `z`:

.. testcode::

  import litebird_sim as lbs
  import numpy as np

  def print_quaternion(q):
      print("{:.3f} {:.3f} {:.3f} {:.3f}".format(*q))

  print("Rotation by π/3 around x:")
  print_quaternion(lbs.quat_rotation_x(theta_rad=np.pi/3))
  print("Rotation by π/3 around y:")
  print_quaternion(lbs.quat_rotation_y(theta_rad=np.pi/3))
  print("Rotation by π/3 around z:")
  print_quaternion(lbs.quat_rotation_z(theta_rad=np.pi/3))

.. testoutput::

   Rotation by π/3 around x:
   0.500 0.000 0.000 0.866
   Rotation by π/3 around y:
   0.000 0.500 0.000 0.866
   Rotation by π/3 around z:
   0.000 0.000 0.500 0.866


There are two functions that implement in-place multiplication of
quaternions: :func:`.quat_right_multiply` performs the calculation
:math:`r \leftarrow r \times q`, and :func:`.quat_left_multiply`
performs the calculation :math:`r \leftarrow q \times r` (where
:math:`\leftarrow` indicates the assignment operation):

.. testcode::

  quat = np.array(lbs.quat_rotation_x(np.pi / 3))
  lbs.quat_left_multiply(quat, *lbs.quat_rotation_z(np.pi / 2))
  print("Rotation by π/3 around x and then by π/2 around z:")
  print_quaternion(quat)

.. testoutput::

   Rotation by π/3 around x and then by π/2 around z:
   0.354 0.354 0.612 0.612

Note the syntax for :func:`.quat_left_multiply`: you are supposed to
pass the four components of the quaternion :math:`q` as separate
arguments, and thus we need to prepend the call to ``lbs.quat_rotation_z``
with ``*`` to expand the result (a 4-element tuple) into the four
parameters required by :func:`.quat_left_multiply`. The reason for
this weird syntax is efficiency, as this kind of function call can be
easily optimized by Numba (which is used extensively in the code).

Finally, the framework provides the function :func:`.rotate_vector`,
which applies the rotation described by a normalized quaternion to a
vector. There are faster versions in :func:`.rotate_x_vector`,
:func:`.rotate_y_vector`, and :func:`.rotate_z_vector` that rotate the
three basis vectors ``(1, 0, 0)``, ``(0, 1, 0)``, and ``(0, 0, 1)``.
The functions :func:`.all_rotate_vectors`,
:func:`.all_rotate_x_vectors`, :func:`.all_rotate_y_vectors`, and
:func:`.all_rotate_z_vectors` can be applied to arrays of quaternions
and vectors.


A simple scanning strategy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We are now ready to discuss how to implement other types of scanning
strategies. There are plenty of reasons why one would like to go
beyond the class :class:`SpinningScanningStrategy`:

1. You want to study the effect of non-idealities, like second-order
   effects caused by contractions/dilations in the mechanical
   structure of the telescope that make the angle between the spin
   axis and the boresight vary with time.

2. You are thinking about how to make dedicated observations of some
   celestial source (e.g., the Crab Nebula) for the purpose of
   calibrating the instruments.

To define a new scanning strategy, we define a descendeant of the
:class:`ScanningStrategy` class, an `Abstract Base Class (ABC)
<https://docs.python.org/3/library/abc.html>`_; the only method that
must be defined is
:meth:`.ScanningStrategy.generate_spin2ecl_quaternions`, which takes
as inputs the start time, the length of the simulation, and the time
interval to be used between consecutive quaternions. The method must
return an instance of the :class:`.Spin2EclipticQuaternions`,
containing the computed sequence of quaternions.

We'll code here a very simple scanning strategy, which does not
involve anything fancy: the spacecraft will just spin around the
Sun-Earth axis, and the boresight direction will be along the same
spin axis. Thus, the boresight detector is going to see only the
points along the Ecliptic plane. This scanning strategy is
scientifically useless, but it's simple enough to be implemented in a
few lines of code:

1. The transformation from boresight to the spin axis reference frame
   is the identity;
2. There is no precession of the spin axis; therefore, the latter
   stays on the Ecliptic axis;
3. The only rotation is caused by the revolution of the Sun-Earth axis
   around the Sun, which is implemented as a rotation on the `xy`
   plane, i.e., around the `z` axis.

The following code implements our mock scanning strategy::

   class SimpleScanningStrategy(lbs.ScanningStrategy):
       def generate_spin2ecl_quaternions(
           self, start_time, time_span_s, delta_time_s,
       ):
           # Compute how many quaternions are needed to cover
           # the time interval specified by "time_span_s"
           num_of_quaternions = (
               lbs.ScanningStrategy.optimal_num_of_quaternions(
                   time_span_s=time_span_s,
                   delta_time_s=delta_time_s,
               )
           )

           # Make room for the quaternions
           spin2ecliptic_quats = np.empty((num_of_quaternions, 4))

           # We compute the times when the quaternions need to be
           # calculated. Note that ScanningStrategy returns two
           # arrays ("time" and "time_s"), but we neglect the second
           # because we don't need it in this very simple case
           (time, _) = lbs.ScanningStrategy.get_times(
               start_time=start_time,
               delta_time_s=delta_time_s,
               num_of_quaternions=num_of_quaternions,
           )

           # Compute the angle on the Ecliptic plane between the x
           # axis and the Sun-Earth axis, possibly using AstroPy
           sun_earth_angles_rad = (
               lbs.calculate_sun_earth_angles_rad(time)
           )

           # This code is *not* optimized: in a real-world case,

               # Rotate by 90° around the y axis (move the boresight

               spin2ecliptic_quats[i, :] = lbs.quat_rotation_y(np.pi / 2)

To test the class ``SimpleScanningStrategy``, we write some code very
similar to the example presented at the beginning of this section.
However, we cannot run the simulation for just one hour, as it would
be not enough to see any change in the pointing direction: the only
things that changes as time passes is the position of the Earth on the
Ecliptic plane, and it takes 365 days to do one revolution. Therefore,
we extend the length of the simulation to 365 days. Of course, there
is no need to use an high sampling frequency in our example, so we use
here just one sample per day; for the same reason, instead of
computing one quaternion every minute, we compute one quaternion every
30 days::

   import astropy.units as u
   import healpy
   import numpy as np

   sim = lbs.Simulation(
       start_time=0,
       duration_s=(365 * u.day).to("s").value,
       description="Sample simulation",
   )

   sim.generate_spin2ecl_quaternions(
       scanning_strategy=SimpleScanningStrategy(),
       delta_time_s=(30 * u.day).to("s").value
   )

   det = lbs.Detector(
       name="foo",
       sampling_rate_hz=1.0 / ((1.0 * u.day).to("s").value),
   )
   (obs,) = sim.create_observations(detectors=[det])
   pointings = obs.get_pointings(sim.spin2ecliptic_quats, np.array([det.quat]))

   m = np.zeros(healpy.nside2npix(64))
   pixidx = healpy.ang2pix(64, pointings[:, 0], pointings[:, 1])
   m[pixidx] = 1
   healpy.mollview(m)

Here is the result: we're indeed scanning the Ecliptic plane!

Observing point sources in the sky
----------------------------------

It is useful to simulate the observation of point sources in the sky,
both for a scientific purpose or for instrument calibration. For
instance, an important task in the calibration of a CMB space
experiment is the estimation of the radiation pattern
:math:`\gamma(\theta, \phi)` for each detector (sometimes
:math:`\gamma` is called the *beam function*). This task can be done
through the observation of a bright point source, like one of the
outer planets (Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, etc.): assuming that the source
is really pointlike and neglecting every other emission from the sky,
the response measured by a detector is proportional to the radiation
pattern :math:`\gamma(\theta, \phi)`, where the angles :math:`\theta,
\phi` identify the position of the planet *in the reference frame of
the detector*, i.e., where :math:`\theta = 0` is the direction of the
main beam axis.

The functions described in this chapter can be used to analyze how
detectors are going to observe point sources in the sky, properly
taking into account proper motions of the sources (this applies to
Solar System objects, like planets and comets). The class
:class:`.Observation` provides the method
:meth:`.get_ecl2det_quaternions`, which has the same syntax as
:meth:`.get_pointings` but returns a matrix with shape ``(N, 4)``
containing the ``N`` quaternions that transform from the Ecliptic
reference frame to the detector's. Thus, this method can be used to
estimate how far from the main beam axis a celestial object is, and
its orientation with the polarization axis.

Here we show a simple example; the first part is identical to the
examples shown above (using the same scanning strategy as CORE's), but
here we employ AstroPy to compute the Ecliptic coordinates of Jupiter
during the simulation and convert them in the reference frame of the
boresight detector using :meth:`.Observation.get_ecl2det_quaternions`:

Again, the vectors printed by this script are in the *reference frame
of the detector*, where the vector ``[0 0 1]`` indicates the main axis
of the detector. We can inspect how close Jupiter moves to the main
beam axis during the simulation if we convert the set of `(x, y, z)`
vectors into the angles :math:`\theta` (colatitude) and :math:`\phi`
(longitude), as the colatitude is simply the angular distance from the
main beam axis (:math:`\theta = 0`)::

  import healpy
  theta, phi = healpy.vec2ang(det_vec)

  import matplotlib.pylab as plt

  times = obs.get_times()
  plt.plot(times - times[0], np.rad2deg(theta))
  plt.xlabel("Time [s]")
  plt.ylabel("Angular separation [deg]")

.. image:: images/jupiter-angular-distance.svg

We see that Jupiter is ~10° away from the beam axis after ~30 seconds
since the start of the simulation.
