class Observation:
    """An observation made by a detector over some time window

    This class encodes the data acquired by a detector over a finite
    amount of time, and it is the fundamental block of a
    simulation. The characteristics of the detector are assumed to be
    stationary over the time span covered by a simulation; these include:

    - Noise parameters
    - Gain

    To access the TOD, use one of the following methods:

    - :py:meth:`.get_times` returns the array of time values (one per
      each sample in the TOD)
    - :py:meth:`.get_tod` returns the array of samples

    Args:
        detector (str): Name of the detector

        start_time: Start time of the observation. It can either be a
            `astropy.time.Time` type or a floating-point number. In
            the latter case, if `use_mjd` is ``False``, the number
            must be expressed in seconds; otherwise, it must be a MJD.

        sampfreq_hz (float): The sampling frequency. Regardless of the
            measurement unit used for `start_time`, this *must* be
            expressed in Hertz.

        nsamples (int): The number of samples in this observation.

        use_mjd (bool): If ``True``, the value of `start_time` is
            expressed in MJD.
