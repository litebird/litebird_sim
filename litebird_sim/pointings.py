class PointingProvider:
    """Provides detector pointing angles and HWP angles based on scanning geometry.

    This class computes time-dependent pointing angles (θ, φ, ψ) and optionally
    Half-Wave Plate (HWP) angles for detectors in a LiteBIRD-like scanning configuration.
    It transforms detector-frame quaternions into sky coordinates using a pre-defined
    rotation from boresight to Ecliptic coordinates.

    Optionally, it also manages HWP angle computation if an `HWP` model is associated.

    Parameters:
        bore2ecliptic_quats (RotQuaternion):
            A time-dependent quaternion representing the rotation from the instrument
            boresight frame to the Ecliptic frame. Typically provided by the scanning simulation.

        hwp (HWP | None):
            An instance of a Half-Wave Plate model. If provided, HWP angles will be
            computed as part of the pointing information.

    Attributes:
        bore2ecliptic_quats (RotQuaternion):
            Rotation from the instrument's boresight frame to the Ecliptic frame.

        hwp (HWP | None):
            Associated Half-Wave Plate model, if any.

    Example:
        provider = PointingProvider(bore2ecliptic_quats=q, hwp=hwp_model)
        pointings, hwp = provider.get_pointings(
        ...     detector_quat=det_q,
