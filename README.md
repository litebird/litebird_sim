<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![LiteBIRD collaboration][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)



### Built With

-   Love!
-   [Python](https://www.python.org)
-   [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/)
-   [NumPy](https://numpy.org)
-   [Astropy](https://www.astropy.org)
-   [Healpix](https://healpix.jpl.nasa.gov)



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps.

### Prerequisites

The LiteBIRD Simulation Framework requires the following tools to be
installed on your system:

1.   Python 3.6 or newer;
2.   [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/), a Python package to handle
     package dependencies and virtual environments.

You probably already have Python installed on your system. To install
Poetry, use one of the following commands:

-   On Linux/Mac OS X, run the following command from the terminal (no
    `sudo` is required):

    ```
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py | python
    ```

-   On Windows, start a Powershell terminal and run the following command:

    ```
    (Invoke-WebRequest -Uri https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/get-poetry.py -UseBasicParsing).Content | python
    ```


### Installation

1.  Install the prerequisites listed above;

2.  Be sure not to have a virtual environment/Conda custom environment
    active, as `poetry` does not plays nicely with them (Poetry handles
    a hidden virtual environment by itself, so there's little point in
    creating one for `litebird_sim`.) See
    [github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1724](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/issues/1724)
    for more details.
    
    Run the following commands to clone this repository, install all
    the dependencies and build the framework:

    ```
    git clone git@github.com:litebird/litebird_sim.git
    cd litebird_sim
    poetry install --extras=jupyter --extras=docs
    poetry build
    ```

    There are a few extras you can enable by adding proper `--extras` flag
    to the `poetry install` command above:

    -   `--extras=jupyter` will enable Jupyter;
    -   `--extras=docs` will install Sphinx and all the tools to
        generate the documentation;
    -   `--extras=mpi` will add support for MPI.

3.  Run the set of tests, to check that everything works. On Linux/Mac OS X:

    ```
    ./bin/run_tests.sh
    ```

    On Windows:

    ```
    .\bin\run_tests.bat
    ```


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

The documentation is available online at
[litebird.github.io/litebird_sim/index.html](https://litebird.github.io/litebird_sim/build/html/index.html).

To create a local copy of the documentation, make sure you ran
`poetry` with the flag `--extras=docs`, then run the following
command:

-   Linux or Mac OS X:
    ```
    ./refresh_docs.sh
    ```

-   Windows:
    ```
    poetry shell
    cd docs
    make.bat html
    ```
