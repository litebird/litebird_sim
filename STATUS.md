## Beam convolution

-   `ducc0` already provides a 4Ï€ convolution code, and it is already
    available within `litebird_sim`
-   A high-level interface to `ducc0` is still missing

## Destriping+calibration map-maker

-   Provided by TOAST2, [PR#86](https://github.com/litebird/litebird_sim/pull/86)

-   [PR#186](https://github.com/litebird/litebird_sim/pull/186) adds the possibility to interface Madam

## Calibration non-idealities

-   Code available in toast-litebird
-   Still not integrated in `litebird_sim`
-   No PR yet

## Cosmic-ray glitch generation

-   Simulation code available
-   Not integrated with the IMO nor with `litebird_sim`
-   No PR yet

## HWP simulation

-   A mathematical model is already available, based on [Giardiello et al. (2021)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210608031G/abstract).
-   [PR#117](https://github.com/litebird/litebird_sim/pull/117).

## ADC simulation

-   Need to simulate the following effects:

    -   Signal quantization
    
    -   Clipping of the signal outside the dynamic range
    
    -   Non-linearity effects
    
-   Signal clipping is already available in the Cosmic-ray glitch
    generator (see above)

## Correlated noise generation

-   Not implemented yet

## Dipole calibration

-   The interface with Ephemerides codes is already in place

-   No PRs yet
